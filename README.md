## README

### Data reader and manager for Rock-Eval 7S raw data files.
The package includes functions to read, plot and convert Rock-Eval data similar to Geoworks. However, for calibration and cursor determination Geoworks is still strongly recommended.
In addition to the main Rock-Eval metrics, further thermogram interpretation, such as T percentiles and partial area calculation, is included.
All functions have a help page and index. An example file for basic use is included in the folder 'Example'.

I'm unsure about Rock-Eval 7 and 6. For 6 I would recommend looking at [PARTYSOC](https://github.com/lauric-cecillon/PARTYsoc).
